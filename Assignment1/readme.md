## Decible
Our group members consisted of Genevieve Anderson, Gaby Nina, Angie Chrichella, and Kylie Wasserman. This semester we worked on creating Decible, and group collaborative project where users are able to submit songs they enjoy, along with discover new songs and playlists. 
In the brainsotrming phase, we came up with the idea to do a music based website becuase music is something that we are all passionate about. 

On our site you can find:
1: home page
2: playlist page
3: about page
4: contact page
5: submit page

On the home page you can find a slideshow which contains images of some of the submitted songs album covers

On thr playlist page you can find the most recent generated playlist connected to spotify. On this page you are able to play the songs through our site, or you can be brought to spotify.

On the about page you can find descriptions and photos of each of the creators.

On the contact page you are able to fill out a form for an email which will be sent to the creators. 

On the submit page you are able to subit songs you enjoy. Each week the creators look at the submissions and curate a playlist based on the most popular submissions.
